Inventory Allocation System
Demo Task 2 – Node.js + React.js
- Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose with Transactions)

Frontend: React.js (Minimal UI)

Architecture Pattern:
Controller → Service → Repository → Model

- Objective

This project demonstrates clean backend architecture, strict API discipline, and concurrency-safe inventory allocation using only one API, as required by the assignment.

The focus of this task is on:

Backend responsibility

Business logic placement

Transaction safety

Race condition prevention

- API Design (STRICTLY FOLLOWED)
- POST /api/order (ONLY API USED)

This single API performs all required operations:

Validate product existence

Validate available stock

Deduct stock

Create order

Prevent negative stock

Handle concurrent requests safely

 No additional APIs were created
No logic was split into multiple endpoints

This design strictly follows the assignment rule of using only one API.

 Business Logic Placement

The application follows clear separation of concerns:

Controller Layer

Handles HTTP request and response only

Contains no business logic

Service Layer

Implements all business logic:

Product validation

Stock validation

Order processing

Transaction handling

Repository Layer

Handles all database interactions

Keeps database logic separate from business logic

This ensures clean, maintainable, and testable code.

 Concurrency & Race Condition Handling

MongoDB sessions and transactions are used

MongoDB is run in Replica Set mode to support transactions

Stock deduction and order creation are executed in one atomic transaction

Prevents race conditions and negative stock scenarios

Edge Case Handled (Mandatory):

Product stock = 5

Order 1 → quantity 3 →  success

Order 2 → quantity 3 →  fails

This confirms correct concurrency handling.

 Frontend (Minimal React Implementation)

Simple React form with:

Product ID input

Quantity input

Calls the same POST /api/order API

Displays success or error message

No business logic or validation handled on frontend

The frontend is intentionally minimal as per assignment instructions.
